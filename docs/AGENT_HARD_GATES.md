# Agent Hard Gates

Status: ALL SEVEN GATES RESOLVED
Decision source: Main Control decision comment on PR #54
Implemented on: `agent/end-to-end-functional-cycle`
Resolved: 2026-08-30

This log records the seven protected business/accounting decisions raised during the end-to-end functional run. Main Control approved all seven decisions. They are implemented, migrated, and covered by the final verification run. No new Hard Gate remains open.

## HG-001 — Cashbox master-data permission

Status: RESOLVED

- Approved decision: add a dedicated `cashboxes.manage_cashboxes` permission. Grant it to Owner and Manager. Accountant retains finance visibility only and does not receive cashbox master-data mutation rights.
- Implementation: the permission is seeded through `permissions/migrations/0004_seed_approved_financial_permissions.py`; cashbox create/edit routes use the new permission and no longer overload `cashboxes.move_cash`.
- Safety result: identity/master-data mutation remains separate from cash movement and financial visibility.
- Verification: role matrix, authorized CRUD, route denial, finance-field visibility, and permission decorator tests passed.
- Primary checkpoint: `15f3aa9`.

## HG-002 — Opening-balance correction semantics

Status: RESOLVED

- Approved decision: an opening balance may be edited directly before operational use. After operational use, correction must be an auditable dated adjustment available to Owner and Accountant, with an append-only reversal rather than deletion or historical rewriting.
- Implementation: `master_data.adjust_opening_balances` is seeded for Owner and Accountant. Customer, supplier, and cashbox adjustments create linked ledger/cash movements, enforce closed-period rules, record actor/reason, and support dated reversal. Direct editing is limited to unused records.
- Schema: adjustment and linkage migrations are included in `cashboxes/0008`, `purchases/0005`, and `sales/0008`.
- Verification: unused and used records, permissions, audit linkage, closed periods, reversal, and report/balance reconciliation passed.
- Primary checkpoint: `15f3aa9`.

## HG-003 — Authoritative sales cost

Status: RESOLVED

- Approved decision: posted sales cost comes from the authoritative inventory movement cost. `Item.average_cost` is a maintained cache, not the accounting source of truth.
- Implementation: inventory services calculate the authoritative moving average from cost-bearing movements; sales posting snapshots that cost transactionally. Cost-affecting inventory operations refresh the item cache without allowing a stale cache value to determine posted cost.
- Verification: stale-cache regression, multiple locations, sales posting/cancellation, returns, stock validation, and profit-report reconciliation passed.
- Primary checkpoints: `efdf0cf`, `6f7e10a`.

## HG-004 — Stock transfer and adjustment services

Status: RESOLVED

- Approved decision: provide transactional stock transfer and adjustment services with linked movements, a required reason, explicit permissions, closed-period enforcement, and append-only reversal.
- Implementation: `inventory.services` owns atomic paired transfers, positive/negative adjustments, authoritative cost handling, source-stock validation, audit metadata, and reversal. Views only call these services.
- Schema: `inventory/migrations/0004_stockmovement_reversal_of_stockoperation_and_more.py` adds operation and reversal linkage.
- Verification: atomic paired directions, insufficient stock, quantity and reason validation, permission denial, cost visibility, closed periods, cache refresh, reversal, UI actions, and responsive behavior passed.
- Primary checkpoint: `efdf0cf`.

## HG-005 — Direct cash operations and cashbox transfers

Status: RESOLVED

- Approved decision: support direct cash in, direct cash out, and cashbox transfer through atomic services. Transfers create linked movements, require a reason, require matching currency, prohibit an overdrawn source, and reverse by appending linked movements.
- Implementation: `cashboxes.services` owns operation creation/cancellation, balance locking, validation, audit metadata, and closed-period enforcement. The UI is gated by `cashboxes.move_cash`.
- Schema: `cashboxes/migrations/0009_cashboxmovement_reversal_of_cashboxoperation_and_more.py` adds operation and reversal linkage.
- Verification: all operation types, atomic directions, same-currency and positive-amount rules, nonnegative source balance, permissions, closed periods, audit, reversal, cashbox report reconciliation, and bilingual responsive UI passed.
- Primary checkpoint: `2b86940`.

## HG-006 — Independent purchase and sales returns

Status: RESOLVED

- Approved decision: model independent return documents linked to the source invoice. Support partial and full quantities within remaining-return caps, reverse stock/party/cash effects, and cancel a return through an append-only reversal.
- Implementation: purchase and sales return headers/lines, services, routes, forms, detail screens, movement/ledger/cash links, settlement handling, costing, and cancellation are implemented. Existing full invoice cancellation remains a separate operation.
- Schema: return models and links are added by `purchases/0006`, `sales/0009`, `inventory/0005`–`0006`, and `cashboxes/0010`–`0011`.
- Verification: partial/full/repeated-return limits, source linkage, stock and authoritative cost, supplier/customer ledger effects, cash refunds, permission denial, closed periods, cancellation reversal, reports, Arabic/English, and responsive layouts passed.
- Primary checkpoint: `6f7e10a`.

## HG-007 — Money rounding and residual allocation

Status: RESOLVED

- Approved decision: use `ROUND_HALF_UP` to two decimal places per line, calculate invoice totals from rounded lines, allocate invoice-level amounts proportionally, and assign the residual to the last allocation so the parts reconcile exactly.
- Implementation: `config/money.py` centralizes money/cost rounding and deterministic proportional allocation. Purchase and sales posting and return services use the shared policy.
- Verification: fractional quantities, half-cent boundaries, discounts, multi-line residuals, exact invoice reconciliation, posting, reversal, returns, average cost, and reports passed.
- Primary checkpoints: `efdf0cf`, `6f7e10a`.

## Final gate verification

- Full Django suite: 793 tests passed in 577.249 seconds.
- Django system check: no issues.
- Production-shaped deployment check: no issues.
- Migration drift check: no changes detected.
- Existing database migration check: current.
- Fresh empty-database migration: all migrations applied successfully; follow-up migration check was current.
- Static collection dry run: all 174 assets resolved.
- Arabic/English and desktop, tablet-landscape, and mobile verification: passed with no page-level overflow or browser console errors on the sampled affected routes.

## PR #54 final-review hardening

The final blocking implementation review did not introduce a new business/accounting decision. The following defects were corrected under the already-approved service and audit rules:

- Django Admin now freezes used Customer, Supplier, and Cashbox opening balances; used Cashbox currency is also immutable. Stock/cash movements and party ledger entries are view-only, and posted/cancelled transactions and their lines cannot be changed or bulk-deleted through Admin.
- Proportional allocations reject negative inputs and cap intermediate rounded shares so every allocation is nonnegative while the exact rounded total is preserved.
- Purchase-return stock validation and sales-return cancellation validation aggregate quantities by item/location before checking availability.
- Sales-return cash refunds lock the Cashbox row before balance validation and movement creation.
- The Cashbox master-data form freezes currency after operational use.
- Stock transfers require a nonblank reason in the form, service, and model validation path.

Regression coverage for every item above is included in the final 793-test run. No migration was required and the model-drift check remains clean.

No unresolved business or accounting decision was discovered while implementing or verifying these approvals.
